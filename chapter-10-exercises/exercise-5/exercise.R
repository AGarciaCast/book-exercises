# Exercise 5: large data sets: Baby Name Popularity Over Time

# Read in the female baby names data file found in the `data` folder into a 
# variable called `names`. Remember to NOT treat the strings as factors!
names <- read.csv("data/female_names.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Create a data frame `names_2013` that contains only the rows for the year 2013
names_2013 <- names[names$year ==2013,]

# What was the most popular female name in 2013?
highestPop <- max(names_2013$prop)
print(names_2013[names_2013$prop == highestPop, "name"])

# Write a function `most_popular_in_year` that takes in a year as a value and 
# returns the most popular name in that year
most_popular_in_year <- function(year){
  highestPop <- max(names[names$year == year, "prop"])
  names[names$prop == highestPop & names$year == year, "name"]
}

# What was the most popular female name in 1994?
print(most_popular_in_year(1994))

# Write a function `number_in_million` that takes in a name and a year, and 
# returns statistically how many babies out of 1 million born that year have 
# that name. 
# Hint: get the popularity percentage, and take that percentage out of 1 million.
number_in_million <- function(name, year){
  round(1000000 * names[names$name == name & names$year == year, "prop"], 1)
}

# How many babies out of 1 million had the name 'Laura' in 1995?
number_in_million("Laura", 1995)

# How many babies out of 1 million had your name in the year you were born?
number_in_million("Alejandro", 1999)

## Consider: what does this tell you about how easy it is to identify you with 
## just your name and birth year?
#Nothing, because this data is based on females names xd
#However, if I were a female that would mean that is not likely to find someone 
#with my name that year
